# AppStormVim
NeoVim configuration done by AppStorming UPM Club.

1. First install VimPlug which will help us to add/remove pluggins quite easilly. To do so, just:

``` bash
curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

2. Clone this repo in ~/.config/nvim/
